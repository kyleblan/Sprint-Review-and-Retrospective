# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

Q: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
A: This process is the primary responsibility of the Product Owner in a Scrum-agile approach, as the Product Owner develops user stories from pieces of information that is collected from the users / customer interface. The user stories then provide the necessary detail and direction to the Development team.
Q: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
A: I typically use a requirements first method of developing a strategy. Once I know what needs to be accomplished, I am able to organize my thoughbts on what piece of functionality will also accomplish my goal. The idea of user stories is common in the work that I do, and will continue to be a part of my future work.
Q: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A: A good team member is consistent in their communication and action, and is available to engage with the team at least a reasonable portion of the time.
